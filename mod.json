But when the <cg>Smart Filter</c> is enabled you will be offered an options as when selecting only triggers. These options will appear in the menu with the <cy>*</c> sign at the end. Additionally only filtered objects will keep their <cp>pink selection</c> and the tool will be applied exclusively to them."
